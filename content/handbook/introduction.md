## Still don't get...

You can consider this a replacement (at least partial) for **HTML**, **CSS** and even **JavaScript** in some cases.

It also fits the following definitions:

* Multi-purpose [HTML Framework](!https://paulbakaus.com/tutorials/css/where-to-start-if-you-want-to-become-a-web-developer/#2_Start_building_your_first_pages_and_sites_with_an_HTML_framework)
* Modern [CSS Framework](!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) with unique set of features.
* [CSS Methodology](!https://www.creativebloq.com/features/a-web-designers-guide-to-css-methodologies) with own future-proof approach.
* Low-level [JS Framework](/framework/what-is-nude) based on Custom Elements with life-cycle hooks and UX-oriented features.
* Comprehensive [Design System](!https://uxmisfit.com/2019/03/26/what-is-a-design-system-everything-you-need-to-know/) out-of-the-box.
* A decent sized set of reusable **UI Components**.

## Who is Numl for?

- **For beginners** – Use a well-thought-out Design System with automatic Dark Scheme and High Contrast Mode for rapid development of adaptive and accessible UIs. Create new components by nesting or/and styling foundation elements.
- **For enthusiastic** – Customize the Numl Design System to the smallest detail in runtime using HTML. Use behaviors and control system to add simple interactions. Add your favorite framework (**Vue.js**, **Angular**, **React**, **Svelte**...) for complex logic.
- **For experts** – Use JavaScript API to create elements that follow your Design System on top of the **Numl**. Integrate Design Tokens into elements to have more control. Add your own unique elements, styles, behaviors, and tokens.

## Another UI Framework? Why should I care?

- **All-in-one** – Numl is both a markup language for rapidly building responsive interfaces and a set of ready-to-use highly-customizable accessible elements. So you can use a single comprehensive tool to compose and style web applications. It's also possible to create simple interactions using only HTML.
- **Unique** – Numl is based on unique CSS generation technology that allows you to unleash all the power of modern CSS and take all styles under your control.
- **DX Focused** – Numl is focused on providing the best possible Developer Experience. It has lots of built-in helpers and solutions for routine UI development and its approach is convenient for maintaining and refactoring.
- **Universal** – Numl is built on top of Web Components, a modern web API to create reusable UI elements, and it's compatible with most modern JS-frameworks. You can use it as is or create lightweight wrappers for your favorite framework to improve DX, SSR and SEO.
